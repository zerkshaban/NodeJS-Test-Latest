# NodeJS-Test-Latest
This test is for us to see how you approach a problem and your way of solving it.
This test needs to be done using NodeJs.
This project needs to be able to run using the command ‘npm start’.
Feel free to add anything “extra” that you deem as relevant for us to understand how you solve
each question.(Algorithms, links, etc.).
Please do not rush through it, take your time. This is not about how fast you do it, it’s about how
you do it.

Question 1:
Write a function that will take a non negative integer n and return the nth digit of Pi.

Question 2:
Write a function that connects to https://restcountries.eu/ and gets a unique country from a
specific name given.

Question 3:
Using the same API ( https://restcountries.eu/ ), and from an array of string, write a function that
returns a list of countries where their name matches at least a part of one of these string.

Question 4:
Considering a Slot machine define like this:
Reel1: [“cherry”, ”lemon”, “apple”, ”lemon”, “banana”, “banana”, ”lemon”, ”lemon”]
Reel2: [”lemon”, “apple”, ”lemon”, “lemon”, “cherry”, “apple”, ”banana”, ”lemon”]
Reel3: [”lemon”, “apple”, ”lemon”, “apple”, “cherry”, “lemon”, ”banana”, ”lemon”]
3 cherries in a row: won 50 coins
2 cherries in a row: won 40 coins
3 Apples in a row: won 20 coins
2 Apples in a row: won 10 coins
3 Bananas in a row: won 15 coins
2 Bananas in a row: won 5 coins
3 lemons in a row: won 3 coins
1 spin = 1 coin
Using these data, create a function that, when it’s called, gives back the result of a spin.

SQL part

Question 1:
